# Best 25 Year Team
## Description
Using CS to determine what combo of players (given a franchise) would be the best in terms of fWAR over the last 25 years with one player taken from each year, complete team filling every position with no duplicates. Using the Blue Jays because Go Jays!

Don&#39;t cheat on positions. Go.</p>&mdash; Russell A. Carleton (@pizzacutter4) <a href="https://twitter.com/pizzacutter4/status/825015479882309632">January 27, 2017</a></blockquote>
